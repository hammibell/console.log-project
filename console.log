               <p>When coding in Visual Studios, there's something called Console Screen, or in other words, Console.log. The console screen is used for important elements in your program to be printed on, or if you want others to see your output code on the console screen instead.</p>

               <p>To see someone's code on the console screen, you'll have to right click on the website, and press inspect. Then, click on the tab that says, "Console", and then voila! You can view the code!</p>
